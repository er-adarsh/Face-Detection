# Face-Detection
Developed a real-time computer vision application using OpenCV and NumPy for face detection and finger counting. The system captures video from the camera, applies background subtraction for face segmentation, and employs traditional computer vision techniques for finger counting. The application serves as a hands-on demonstration of computer vision concepts, offering an interactive experience for users.

Key Features:

Real-time face detection using contour analysis.
Finger counting based on convex hull analysis.
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for interactive demonstrations.
Utilizes OpenCV and NumPy for image processing and analysis.

Tech Stack:
Python, OpenCV, NumPy.
